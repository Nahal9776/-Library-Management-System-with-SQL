📚 Library Management System with SQL:
A simple yet robust offline Library Management System built with PostgreSQL, Java Servlet, JSP, and RESTful Web Services. This project is designed to help students and developers understand the principles of relational database systems, SQL querying, and backend development while providing practical experience in real-world application development.

🎯 Objectives : 
This project has three main objectives:
Functional: Provide a full-featured system to manage library operations like cataloging books, user management, and book circulation.
Instructional: Help students and database enthusiasts learn about database design, normalization, and SQL.
Preservation: Highlight the importance of digital preservation for long-term accessibility of data.

👥 Stakeholders : 
Library Visitors – Students, faculty, and general users who borrow/return books.
Librarians – Manage catalogs, loans, and user records.
Library Managers – Oversee budget, resources, and system scalability.
Students & Developers – Gain hands-on experience with database systems.
